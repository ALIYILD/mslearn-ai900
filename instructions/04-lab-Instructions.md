  **Note:** When you open Visual Studio Code, you may be prompted to answer _Do you trust the authors of the file in this folder?_. Select **Trust the authors of all files in the parent folder 'Documents'** and select **Yes I trust the authors**.

2.  We will pull the latest version of the project. In the open terminal type +++getfiles.cmd+++ and press **enter**. This command pulls the latest version of the project to your folder. 
3.  Once the command runs, you can close the terminal panel. Now you can begin the lab.
